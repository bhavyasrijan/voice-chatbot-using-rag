Voice to RAG Conversational Chatbot Using Gemini, LlamaIndex and GCP VTT TTS APIs

Developed a web application that provides accessible information about benefit programs, government policies, and other resources for parents of children with mental disabilities. The application will allow parents to ask questions in their native language (primarily Spanish), process the speech to provide accurate and helpful responses, and deliver the information in the same language.
