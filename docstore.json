During these sessions, participants  shared that they used the 2015 policy statement to drive \nchanges in po licies and practices to support the inclusion of young children with disabilities  across \nmultiple levels of the early childhood system . Some examples include :  \n\u2022 Increased awareness of the benefits of early childhood inclusion  led many States  and local \ncommunities  to prioritiz e inclusion and improve  policies and practices that support inclusion in \nState  and local system  level plans.  \n\u2022 Early childhood programs and providers  improve d their policies , practices , and early learning \nenvironments  to support the inclusion of  young children with disabilities and their families  in their \nprograms and services . \n\u2022 Higher education  faculty  and training and TA  providers  used the policy  statement as an essential \ncomponent of trainings and professional development  (PD)  and TA support . They created new \nresources and documents to highlight the policy statement  and support implementation of its  \nrecommendations . \n\u2022 Families  used the policy statement as a tool to bring awareness to the importance of inclusion,  \nand advocate for more inclusive services and practices  across early childhood settings .

The \nCommunity Inclusion T eams (CIT s) consist of family members, program implementation coaches, \nearly inte rvention and early childhood special education providers, community partners, and early \neducational agency partners. The CIT s have implemented action plans based on both the \nCommunity and Local Program Indicators of High -Quality Inclusion that guide and su pport the \navailability of high -quality inclusive early childhood programs throughout the community. Oregon\u2019s \nImplementation Programs (IPs) and Demonstration Sites support programs in implementing the \nEarly Care and Education Environment Indicators of High -Quality Inclusion. IP Leadership T eams \nmeet monthly and work to build capacity to implement community action plans, change practices, \nand enhance policies and procedures to maximize access, participation, supports and outcomes for \nchildren with disabilitie s. The IPs will be used to examine the effectiveness of the inclusion \nindicators and provide a model for replication. CIT s across the State meet to identify solutions and \nshare data. All CIT s reported improvements to their systems, and significant improvem ent on the \nIndicators of High -Quality Inclusion. Following community implementation, the State has examined \nits educational environments data and seen signs of progress.
